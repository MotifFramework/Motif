Media Object

The Media Object is an image (or media-type) to the left with (typically) 
descriptive content to the right. The media object can be whatever size it 
wants, the basic format will remain the same. (Text will **not** wrap.)  This 
has any number of applications, such as a checkbox next to a label with lots 
of text.

I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>

Figures

Great for integrating images into bodies of text, the `.media__figure` class is 
modified by the `--left` and `--right` keywords depending on where you would 
like it placed.

````plain-media
<figure class="media__figure">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/800x444" alt="A full-width photo">

    <img src="http://placehold.it/800x444" alt="A full-width photo with a caption">
    <figcaption class="media__figcaption">This caption enhances the photo above. It should only be a brief sentence or two long.</figcaption>
